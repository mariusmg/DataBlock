- introduce support for stored procs calls in PersistentObject. This means
that any operation made with TableMetadata can also be made with a stored procedure.  [not implemented]


   NOTE : need to check the transaction compliance (if i can match both stored procs and
sql queries into the same transaction before implementing that).



- add support for multiple deletes/updates using a QueryCriteria in PersistentObject.
This must be done in order to allow the user to generate queries like :
"Update Person SET Name = 'Gogu' WHERE Age > 43;
                								(DONE)	


- add support (in PersistentObject) for saving/loading graphs of objects (this will sooooooooo tricky).


- add support for external file configuration. This will be done to avoid
passing the connection string and database server type all over. This is 
useful when the user wants to connect to a single database. 
								(DONE)


//- integrate the caching mechanism.  (not a priority for now)



- add support for TRACE mode. 
								(DONE)
